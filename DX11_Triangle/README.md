# Mesh Simplication

This repository holds mesh simplification, a project based on edge-collapse algorithm, which is put forward by Michael Garland and  Paul S. Heckbert in 1997.

 
## Description

-- This is the homework of Computer Graphics, a course in spring semester, 2016.

-- You can download this project to complile by executing "make" command or test it by executing "main.exe [input.obj] [output.obj] [ratio]".
